You&rsquo;d be wise to have a really great vocal performance on your recording to help sell the artist and label on cutting your song. Your production should be competitive for this pitch.

<p>Give them rhythmically and melodically expressive songs that sound like a true EDM cut, with plenty of great big builds, infectious beats, and a really compelling vocal performance. Your songs should use fresh Electronic sounds and production techniques with tons of catchy ear-candy from top to bottom. Do NOT copy or rip off the referenced artists in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a guide for tempo, texture, and tone. Broadcast Quality is needed (great sounding home recordings are fine).</p>
<p>NOTE: This company also pitches music for film, TV, and Commercials, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon for them to offer and sign deals with the composers and artists they find while hunting for the in-store music! </p>
<p>NOTE 2: Please include a bio and photo with your submissions, as this company often may use them on their website or other promotional media.</p>
<p>Quoting the Company: &ldquo;Performance Royalties will be paid by the media company, and at a &lsquo;WAY HIGHER RATE&rsquo; than what is paid by conventional Performing Rights Organizations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This company offers a NON-EXCLUSIVE Deal, so you will keep 100% of all Composition and Master Rights. You must own or control your Master and Copyright to submit for this opportunity.

<p>INSTRUMENTALS and SONGS are both okay to submit: 
If you submit songs with lyrics, they should be emotionally upbeat, fun, and can be about topics like having fun, going out on the town, living life to the fullest, celebrating life and friends, etc. We&rsquo;ve all seen commercials with a group of young ladies going out to have fun together in their awesome new clothes or shoes, haven&rsquo;t we? That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re guessing this video/commercial will be like.</p>
<p>The Deal Points: 
One-Year License for Internet and In-Store Plays (synced to picture). Estimated sync fee, $15,000 - $20,000 (not 100% verified at press time, but from a very reliable source! We are going conservative, and calling it $15,000. You will likely be asked to NOT license your music for any other advertising for the term of the deal (One Year), so that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re calling it Semi-Exclusive. They will not take any ownership of the Copyright or Master recording. </p>
<p>Broadcast Quality is needed (great sounding home recordings are fine). You must own or control 100% of the Master and Composition rights. Please include lyrics if you submit a song! Please submit one to three Songs or Instrumentals online or per CD. All submissions will be screened on a Yes/No basis. No full critiques. All submissions must be received no later than THURSDAY, March 16th at 1:59pm (PDT).

<p>Please submit songs that are reflective of the &rsquo;80s era, but with a fresh and current approach. Your songs should have strong, engaging melodies, with catchy hooks and choruses. Your production should contain modern Electronic characteristics incorporated with some with live instrumentation like funky bass lines and cool electric guitar riffs. Your vocal performance should be contemporary and have plenty of personality and attitude. </p>
<p>Although they didn&rsquo;t ask for specific lyric themes, universal lyrics that avoid specific names, places, dates, times, brands, and profanity are always a good bet.

Please listen to the following examples to get an idea of the range of music that could work for this pitch: </p>
<p>Note: This Company ran a few listings with TAXI early last year, which resulted in adding several writers to their roster.</p>

<p>Quoting the company: &ldquo;We're getting strong interest from the ad agencies [that do Film Trailers] for more Cover Songs -- more than we can produce! It's not necessary to use all lines and lyrics from a song, but it&rsquo;s very wise to retain the key lyrics and the overall melody. It could be as simple as using one key line from a verse and then a repeated chorus. The energy of the vocal performance and the arrangement should grow stronger through the song, ending with a minimum 30-second climax section.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additional info from the company: &ldquo;Covering older hits is better than covering newer songs. The newer songs from charting artists will prove difficult, if not impossible to gain approval from the publisher/artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please submit re-imagined Cover Versions of familiar songs that would lend themselves well to this relatively new style of music often heard in Film Trailers. One approach is to take an &ldquo;old-ish&rdquo; up-tempo hit (from the &lsquo;60s, &lsquo;70s, &lsquo;80s, &lsquo;90s, for example), and do an ethereal, slowed-down version with haunting vocals, and a big, dramatic chorus section. </p>
<p>Think about flipping things on their heads! Take a Rock song and do a Country Version. Take a Country Song and try a Hip Hop version. Get creative, but stick with the original melody so the songs remain recognizable, even in their cool, new form! Versions that add drama and build as they go will work well. If you create something light and &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; for a indie love story-type of Trailer, go for a big, heartwarming climax at the end. </p>
<p>Trailers are almost always in three acts, so starting out sparsely in the first third, build it up in the second third, and bring it all to a dramatic (or heartwarming) climax in the last section of your cover, and you&rsquo;ll make it very useable. </p>
<p>TAXI Tip: Your productions can range from stripped-down versions that might only be a guitar/vocal, piano/vocal, ukulele/vocal, or a band-sized ensemble, or even a full orchestral version. You should go into this thinking, &ldquo;What could I do with this song that would make it sound totally different than the original version, and make it sound really cool for those trendy new Film Trailers I see/hear these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your songs should be full-length, in the 3 to 4 minute ballpark. Non-Faded/Buttoned endings will work best for this pitch. Do NOT copy or rip off the referenced songs in any way, shape, or form. Use them only as a very general guide for tempo, tone, and overall vibe. But do NOT limit yourself to just those examples!!! Broadcast Quality is needed (great sounding home recordings are fine).</p>
<p>This Library offers an Exclusive deal. You&rsquo;ll split all upfront sync fees 60/40 (60% goes to the Artist/Writer/Producer). You must own or control your Master recording to pitch for this.

If you&rsquo;ve got old recordings that sound like they could be on a playlist with the references they gave us, or anything that would have been a playlist with those acts, you might have exactly what this awesome publisher needs:</p>

<p>You can submit old masters or demos for this pitch. The recording quality is not expected to be on par with today&rsquo;s broadcast quality! Many TAXI members have been signed by this publisher with nothing more than good demo recordings! They&rsquo;re much more interested finding music that sounds authentic to the time period!</p>
<p>This Publisher is the hot, go-to company for a long list of extremely popular TV shows and big Feature Films when they need music that is authentically from a particular time period. The Publisher pays you upfront for the master rights and the Publisher&rsquo;s share of the copyright, and you keep the Writer&rsquo;s Share of the publishing and earn income from performance royalties paid by your Performing Rights Organization.</p>
<p>This company often averages several placements per week, and many of those are TAXI members who&rsquo;ve been signed with this company because they submitted to a listing like this! Dozens of TAXI members have signed buy out, cash-up-front deals with this company. Several have even received up front checks for $10,000 - $15,000 (or more!) Deal sizes and buyout amounts vary depending on the quantity and quality of the songs signed by the Publisher.</p>
<p>They DO NOT want material that was recently recorded and made to sound old. They can only use AUTHENTIC, ORIGINAL, VINTAGE RECORDINGS, as long as the sound quality is reasonably good. This is a golden opportunity to make money with music you might have thought had no hope in today&rsquo;s market!</p>
<p>Your name needs to be on the copyright. Your songs need to be original compositions (no covers), and you need to own or control the copyright and master recordings to submit for this pitch. DO NOT SUBMIT FOR FRIENDS! Please submit one to three songs online or per CD. Please include lyrics. All submissions will be screened on a Yes/No basis - No full critiques.

<p>Quoting The Source: &ldquo;Looking for an Alternative/Indie Rock sound that can be competitive with mainstream Pop Top 40, and has a distinctive style that stands out from the common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please submit commercially appealing songs that are catchy as hell, rhythmically and melodically interesting, and have an unforgettable chorus. Your production should have traditional &ldquo;Indie&rdquo; instrumentation, a strong Rock edge, and still have the commercial, mainstream appeal that will help it compete on the Top 40 chart. Some electronic elements can work, but you&rsquo;d be wise to keep them somewhat minimal so they won&rsquo;t take away from the Indie Rock Vibe. Be sure to have a solid, memorable vocal performance that shows off your personality and attitude!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mainly interested in artists and bands that are actively working on their careers, so please include any touring, fan base, sales, streaming, or impressive social media figures you have in your bio. That said, A&amp;R people always love to hear hits, regardless.
